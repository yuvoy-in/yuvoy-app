/**
 * Fails the build if the checked-in contract no longer matches the ref it is
 * pinned to, or if the generated types are stale against the contract.
 *
 * Both halves matter. A contract that has moved on the server and a schema
 * that was not regenerated after a contract bump produce the same symptom —
 * types that say one thing and responses that do another — and that symptom
 * surfaces at runtime, in checkout, on a traveller's phone.
 *
 * Network failures do NOT fail the check. A build must not depend on GitHub
 * being reachable; it warns and moves on, and the drift is caught on the next
 * run that can reach the network.
